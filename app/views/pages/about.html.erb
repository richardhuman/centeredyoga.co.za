        <p>
        I began practicing yoga 14 years ago as a result of a back injury.  I started in the Iyengar tradition, left South Africa for an opportunity to live and work in Amsterdam, where I began a second teacher training programme, grounded in the principles of alignment and the 8 vital principles as described and taught to me by <%= link_to "Dona Holleman", "http://www.donaholleman.com" %> and <%= link_to "Teresa Caldas", "http://www.studioasana.com" %>.

            I obtained the Classical Yoga Teachers Diploma in June of 2004.  This diploma is based on BKS Iyengar’s ‘Light on Yoga’ and the 8 principles as written down by Dona Holleman in her book: Dancing the Body of Light.  Our course strongly focused on self practice, correct methods of assisting and correction, advanced practice of all Asanas, Pranayama techniques, Bandhas and Kriyas and a thorough understanding of anatomy and the historical texts of Patanjali.
