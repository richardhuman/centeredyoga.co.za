        Hi
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm Jane and I teach Centered Yoga.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I teach several groups (checkout my <%= link_to "class schedule", "classes" %>) but also teach private clients. 
        <br/>        
        <br/>        
        I also have experience in teaching pre-natal and medical classes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
                
        
        
    </div>
